        <p id="tribute-info">Cam’ron is no stranger to the world of fashion. Last month, as New York designer Telfar Clemens debuted his collaboration with fast food chain White Castle, the Harlem rapper was scheduled to perform on the roof of the restaurant’s Queens location, before the NYPD preemptively shut it down. But even if the show had gone ahead, it would have been decidedly more low-key than Cam’ron’s most famous fashion appearance – a moment of sheer pop culture brilliance, and one in which he engineered what may be the most enduring, iconic and widely-shared NYFW photo of all time. Yes, we’re talking about that baby pink, furry outfit.</p>

    In 2002, after a Baby Phat fashion show – the spin-off brand from the then-wildly popular clothing brand Phat Farm, owned by rap mogul Russell Simmons and designed by his wife, Kimora Lee – Cam’ stepped out in front of the paparazzi. Although he had already broken into the top twenty of the US’s Billboard 200 by this point, with tracks like “Oh Boy” and “Hey Ma”, and developed a penchant for pink ensembles, this was Cam’ron’s first fashion week. He came prepared to dazzle. Dressed head to toe in pink, he stood holding a pose for several moments, a flip phone held to his ear, the exact same shade as his fur coat and hat.</p>
    
        <p id="tribute-info">
    In the years since, the look has spawned tribute t-shirts, socks, bathing suits and a whole line of Cam’ron’s own apparel emblazoned with the image. It has also inspired a new Pantone colour; been referenced by the likes of Kanye West, 2 Chainz and Frank Ocean; as well as being incorporated into recent videos by the likes of Solange and Rihanna, and serving as the inspiration for countless Halloween costumes. Oh, and you can get Cam’ron pink fur ensemble emojis too.</p>
