MY WEBSITE!

<h2>What can my website do?</h2>
<ul><li>It can explain the purpose of my website.</li>
<li>It can redirect you to my public profiles.</li>
<li>The "Do you have an advice" page is a form that sends me an e-mail.</li>
<li>When e-mail is sent, it thanks you.</li>
<li>For now it is powered by FormSubmit, but I plan to switch to a form that I made from zero.</li>
<li>There is a cool picture of Krusty the Clown. I will replace it with a good photo of mine (hopefully)</li>
<li>It also has a good UI.</li></ul>
